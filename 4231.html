        <div class="title">The 4-2-3-1 Formation: The Double Pivot</div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <h2>Tactical Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 4-2-3-1 formation is a versatile and widely adopted tactical setup in modern football. It is characterized by four defenders, two central defensive midfielders (CDMs), three attacking midfielders, and a lone striker. This formation offers a perfect balance between defense and attack, making it a favorite among many top clubs and national teams.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Defensive Structure:</strong> The foundation of the 4-2-3-1 formation lies in its solid defensive structure. The four defenders typically consist of two center-backs and two full-backs. The center-backs provide stability at the heart of the defense, while the full-backs offer width and support both defensively and offensively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Midfield Dominance:</strong> The two CDMs play a pivotal role in maintaining midfield control. One of them often operates as a deep-lying playmaker, distributing the ball, and orchestrating attacks from a deep position. The other CDM acts as a ball-winner, breaking up opposition plays and providing cover for the defense.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attacking Creativity:</strong> The three attacking midfielders positioned ahead of the CDMs offer a range of creative options. The central attacking midfielder (CAM) is the chief playmaker, responsible for unlocking opposition defenses with precise passes and through balls. The wide midfielders (usually a combination of wingers and wide playmakers) provide width, dribbling ability, and crossing expertise. Their role is to stretch the opponent's defense and create goal-scoring opportunities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lone Striker:</strong> The lone striker in the 4-2-3-1 formation is the primary goal-scoring threat. They are often tasked with holding up play, making intelligent runs, and finishing chances. The striker's ability to link up with the midfield and provide an outlet for passes is crucial for the team's attacking fluidity.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <h3>Defensive Structure</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Center-Backs:</strong> The two center-backs in the 4-2-3-1 formation are tasked with providing a solid defensive foundation. They need to be strong in aerial duels, good at intercepting passes, and capable of making crucial tackles. Their positioning is essential to maintain a compact defensive shape.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Full-Backs:</strong> The full-backs in this formation play a dual role. They contribute to the defense by tracking back and supporting the center-backs when necessary. Simultaneously, they provide width in the attack, pushing forward along the flanks to create overloads and deliver crosses.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                    
                            <li>
                                <h3>Midfield Dominance</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Central Defensive Midfielders:</strong> The two CDMs are the key to controlling the midfield. One CDM often operates as a deep-lying playmaker, responsible for distributing accurate long balls and initiating attacks from a deeper position. The other CDM focuses on defensive duties, breaking up opposition plays, and protecting the backline. Their partnership is crucial for maintaining a balanced midfield.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Central Attacking Midfielder:</strong> The CAM is the creative engine of the team. Positioned centrally, they orchestrate the team's attacks, often serving as the primary playmaker. Their vision, passing accuracy, and ability to unlock tight defenses with through balls are vital assets.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Attacking Play</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Wide Midfielders/Wingers (RM/LM or RW/LW):</strong> The wide midfielders or wingers in the 4-2-3-1 formation provide width in the attack. They have the responsibility of stretching the opponent's defense by hugging the touchline and using their dribbling skills to take on defenders. These players often have license to cut inside, take on shots, or create goal-scoring opportunities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Striker:</strong> The lone striker is the primary goal-scoring threat. They must excel in holding up play, making intelligent runs, and finishing chances. Their ability to link up with the midfielders is crucial for creating goal-scoring opportunities. In some variations, the striker may have a more physical presence, while in others, they may possess speed and agility.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                    
                            <li>
                                <h3>Defensive Pressing and Transition</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>High Pressing:</strong> The 4-2-3-1 formation allows for effective pressing high up the pitch. The attacking quartet behind the lone striker can coordinate to press the opposition's defense and midfield, disrupting their build-up play and forcing turnovers in advanced areas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Transition Play:</strong> Transitioning from defense to attack is a hallmark of this formation. When the team regains possession, the attacking midfielders and full-backs transition quickly to exploit any spaces left behind by the opposition. This swift transition can lead to rapid counterattacks, catching the opponent off balance.
                                </p>

                                    <li>The 4-2-3-1 formation is known for its adaptability.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Double Pivot CDMs:</strong> Some teams opt for a "double pivot" in the CDM positions, where both players focus on defensive duties. This approach adds extra solidity in midfield but may require more creative responsibilities for the CAM.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inverted Wingers:</strong>Instead of traditional wingers, teams may deploy inverted wingers who cut inside onto their stronger foot. This variation allows for more centralized attacks and increased goal-scoring opportunities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>False 9:</strong>Occasionally, a team may use a false 9 instead of a traditional striker. In this case, the CAM or one of the wide attackers takes on the role of the forward, dropping deep to create space for others.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
