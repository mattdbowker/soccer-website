            <div class="content">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <h2>Tactical Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 3-4-3 formation, often referred to as the "3-back" formation, is a captivating tactical setup that balances defensive stability and attacking flair. This formation is characterized by three defenders, four midfielders, and three forwards, making it a dynamic choice for teams aiming to assert dominance on the field.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Defensive Structure:</strong>In the 3-4-3 formation, the defensive structure relies on three center-backs who form a strong defensive line. They excel in reading the game, winning aerial duels, and initiating attacks from the back. Complementing them are the wing-backs, who provide defensive cover while contributing significantly to the attack through overlapping runs and precise crosses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Midfield Control:</strong> Midfield control is achieved through the presence of two central midfielders (CMs) who serve as the engine room of the team. These versatile players contribute both defensively and offensively, controlling the game's tempo, distributing passes, and offering support to the attack. The wide midfielders (WMs) or wingers add width to the team's shape, making it challenging for opponents to defend. Their dribbling skills, speed, and precise crosses make them valuable assets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attacking Play:</strong> The attacking play in the 3-4-3 formation revolves around the forward trio. This trio consists of a central striker flanked by two wide forwards. The central striker is the primary goal-scoring threat, while the wide forwards provide crucial support and contribute to goal-scoring opportunities. Their movements, interplay, and ability to finish chances are pivotal in the team's attacking prowess.</li>

                <h2>History:</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>The 3-4-3 formation has a rich and varied history in football tactics. While its modern interpretation has evolved over time, notable moments in its historical context include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AC Milan's "Gre-No-Li" Era:</strong>In the 1950s, AC Milan under coach Nereo Rocco utilized a formation similar to the 3-4-3, known for its attacking prowess. The trio of Gunnar Nordahl (Gre), Nils Liedholm (No), and Gunnar Gren (Li) led the team to success.</li>
                        <li><strong>Antonio Conte's Revolution:</strong>Italian coach Antonio Conte popularized the 3-4-3 formation during his time at Juventus and later Chelsea. His adaptation of this formation brought domestic league titles and played a pivotal role in Chelsea's Premier League triumph in the 2016-2017 season.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                                <h3>Defensive Structure</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Three Center-Backs:</strong> The core of the 3-4-3 formation consists of three center-backs who provide a solid defensive foundation. Their primary responsibilities include marking opposing forwards, intercepting passes, and winning aerial duels. The presence of three CBs adds an extra layer of security, making it difficult for opposing strikers to find space in the central areas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Wing-Backs:</strong> The two wing-backs in this formation play a critical role in both defense and attack. Defensively, they are tasked with tracking back to support the center-backs, helping to maintain a compact defensive shape. Offensively, they push high up the field, creating overloads on the flanks, and providing width for the team's attacks. Their ability to deliver crosses and participate in the attack is pivotal.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                    
                            <li>
                                <h3>Midfield Dominance</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Central Midfielders:</strong> In the 3-4-3 formation, there are typically two central midfielders. These players are essential for maintaining control of the midfield. One CM often operates as a deep-lying playmaker, orchestrating the team's build-up from deeper positions. The other CM may focus on ball recovery and providing support in both defensive and offensive phases.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Wide Midfielders:</strong> The wide midfielders, also acting as wing-backs in certain instances, are responsible for stretching the opposition horizontally. They hug the touchlines, creating space in the central areas for the attacking trio. These players often possess dribbling skills, pace, and the ability to deliver crosses, making them effective in one-on-one situations and during offensive transitions.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Attacking Play</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Front Three:</strong> The attacking trio is a key feature of the 3-4-3 formation. It typically includes a central striker flanked by two wide forwards. The central striker serves as the primary goal-scoring threat, often combining hold-up play with intelligent runs behind the defense. The wide forwards provide support, drift into goal-scoring positions, and contribute to build-up play. Their movements and interchangeability can create confusion for opposing defenses.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                    
                            <li>
                                <h3>Defensive Pressing and Transition</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>High Pressing:</strong> The 3-4-3 formation allows for effective pressing high up the pitch. The attacking trio, along with the central midfielders and wing-backs, can coordinate their efforts to engage the opposition's defenders and disrupt their build-up. This high press aims to win the ball back quickly in advanced areas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Quick Transition:</strong> Transitioning from defense to attack is a key strength of this formation. When the team regains possession, the wing-backs and wide midfielders transition rapidly to support the attack. Their ability to exploit spaces left by the opposition and create numerical advantages can lead to fast and incisive counterattacks.

                                    <li>The 3-4-3 formation is adaptable to different styles of play. Teams can choose to emphasize possession, quick transitions, or a balanced approach based on their strengths and the opponent's weaknesses. The presence of versatile players who can play multiple roles within the formation adds to its flexibility.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Inverted Wingers:</strong>Some teams opt for inverted wingers in the wide forward positions. In this case, the wide forwards cut inside onto their stronger foot, looking to create goal-scoring opportunities through dribbling or shooting. This variation can add unpredictability to the attack.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Single Defensive Midfielder:</strong>In certain variations of the 3-4-3, one of the central midfielders may play a more defensive role, acting as a lone defensive midfielder (CDM). This setup provides additional stability in front of the defense while allowing the other CM to focus on creativity.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    </div>
